# DashApp

The purpose of this project is to develop a SaaS (Software as a Service) application, which goal is to provide relevant information to the users daily planning and routine, such as news, to-do lists or the weather forecast, in a combined and customizable way.

The application has been named Dashpot, and it is a customizable dashboard, in which the user can choose the widgets to show, the position on the screen and their configuration.

The project has been developed using the MEAN stack as a framework, along with the technologies for web projects, such as HTML and CSS, following an agile development methodology and applying the principles of SCRUM and BDD (Behaviour Driven Development).

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
